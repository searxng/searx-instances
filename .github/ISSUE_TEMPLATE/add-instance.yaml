        ### General

        Enter your instance URL in the title above ( For example: `Add https://searxng.example.com` )

        Your instance will receive requests from the host `check.searx.space` (the IP addresses of this host may change in the future).
        Currently, if you don't give the right to `check.searx.space` to check your instance, it is not possible to add your instance to the list.

        If you don't respect all the requirements your instance can't be added.
        And if later after we add your instance, we found out that your instance fail to respect all requirements, we will remove it.

        ### Recommendations for your instance

        - Do not use Cloudflare or any other commercial solution that analyze the HTTP traffic between the user and the server.
          It's forbidden because you are not in control of the final webserver.
          Also, it's bad for the privacy because the provider can see all the HTTP traffic between the users and your server.
          Prefer using [the built-in limiter plugin](https://docs.searxng.org/src/searx.plugins.limiter.html#limiter-plugin) for SearxNG or [filtron](https://github.com/searxng/filtron) for SearX.
        - Don't block JavaScript users with CAPTCHA that only work with JavaScript, page that verify the user with JavaScript and so on.
        - Try to harden the TLS security of your server by getting an A+ TLS grade on https://cryptcheck.fr.
          You can use https://ssl-config.mozilla.org to get A+ TLS grade.
        - Try to harden the security of your users when they use your instance by getting an A+ CSP grade on https://observatory.mozilla.org.
          Look into https://github.com/searxng/searx-docker/blob/master/Caddyfile#L33-L84 to get A+ CSP grade.
        - Enable the parameter `use_mobile_ui` in the `settings.yml` file for the Google engine. This will avoid any future rate limit errors from Google.
        - Configure IPv6 on your server, if your provider supports it please enable it. The future of the internet will thank you, see [why here](https://old.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1k45y7/eli5_what_is_ipv6_and_why_is_it_so_important/).

        Did you install a bot protection ?

        Be sure to configure a bot protection:
        * once your instance is added to searx.space, it will receive requests from different bots which may increase its chance of getting blocked by various search engines.
        * removing your instance from searx.space won't stop the bots and thus will most likely not unblock it from the various search engines.

        We recommend the usage of [the built-in limiter plugin](https://docs.searxng.org/src/searx.plugins.limiter.html#limiter-plugin) if you are using SearXNG or [filtron](https://github.com/searxng/filtron) if you are using SearX.

        ⚠️ If you have installed [filtron](https://github.com/searxng/filtron), we urge you to use the [rules from searx-docker](https://github.com/searx/searx-docker/blob/master/rules.json). Please double check if you are using them.
      options:
        - "No, I have not installed a bot protection and I do recognize that without one, my instance will be flooded by bots and could have some of its engines stop working (an example is Google)."
        - "Yes, I have installed filtron (rules.json from searx-docker)."
        - "Yes, I have installed filtron (other rules)."
        - "Yes, I have enabled the limiter plugin built in SearXNG."
        - "Yes, I have installed another bot protection."
