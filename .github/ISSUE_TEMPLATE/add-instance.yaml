        ### General

        Enter your instance URL in the title above ( For example: `Add https://searxng.example.com` )

        Your instance will receive requests from the host `check.searx.space` (the IP addresses of this host may change in the future).
        Currently, if you don't give the right to `check.searx.space` to check your instance, it is not possible to add your instance to the list.

        If you don't respect all the requirements your instance can't be added.
        And if later after we add your instance, we found out that your instance fail to respect all requirements, we will remove it.
        We may in the future adapt these rules, but you will be notified if your instance fails to respect the new rules.

        ### Recommendations for your instance

        - Do not use Cloudflare or any other commercial solution that analyze the HTTP traffic between the user and the server.
          It's forbidden because you are not in control of the final webserver.
          Also, it's bad for the privacy because the provider can see all the HTTP traffic between the users and your server.
          Prefer using [the built-in limiter plugin](https://docs.searxng.org/src/searx.plugins.limiter.html#limiter-plugin).
        - Don't block JavaScript users with CAPTCHA that only work with JavaScript, page that verify the user with JavaScript and so on.
        - Try to harden the TLS security of your server by getting an A+ TLS grade on https://cryptcheck.fr.
          You can use https://ssl-config.mozilla.org to get A+ TLS grade.
        - Try to harden the security of your users when they use your instance by getting an A+ CSP grade on https://observatory.mozilla.org.
          Look into https://github.com/searxng/searx-docker/blob/master/Caddyfile#L33-L84 to get A+ CSP grade.
        - Configure IPv6 on your server, if your provider supports it please enable it. The future of the internet will thank you, see [why here](https://old.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1k45y7/eli5_what_is_ipv6_and_why_is_it_so_important/).

        Please enable the `server.public_instance` parameter as explained in this documentation: https://gist.github.com/unixfox/4e22730769540fe5b9f1943a86439761
        We can make exceptions in case you really do not want to enable our bot limiter solution, but you will have to send us proofs as a comment in the issue:
        clearly stating how you detect bots, how you actively deal with them and also prove that it really works.
